`Hex-Monscape` is a simple turn-based game created for Haraj Solutions Team onboarding process.

In the game source code, you can find the team's secret technique in writing production code for [Haraj](https://haraj.com.sa) services that help serve millions of users daily in Saudi Arabia despite only having a handful of team members. ü•∑üèªüí•

The secret technique actually lies in the software architecture we choose for these services: [Hexagonal Architecture](./docs/reference/hex-architecture.md).

In this repo, we use this remarkable architecture to structure `Hex Monscape` server code while implementing it using [Golang](https://go.dev/). For the web client, we implement it using [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/).

To get started on how we apply [Hexagonal Architecture](./docs/reference/hex-architecture.md) to this game, please refer to [this doc](./docs/reference/hex-architecture.md).

To start playing the game, please refer to [How to Run The Game](#how-to-run-the-game) section.

> **Note:**
>
> Many people got interested in software engineering because of games, so using games as a medium for transferring knowledge to our team members might be a fun idea. This is why we created this project. üòÉ
>
> Even though we are using Golang to implement [Hexagonal Architecture](./docs/reference/hex-architecture.md) in this repo, the architecture itself is language agnostic. So we can also apply it to other languages such as PHP, Typescript, & Python.

## Background Story

One of the most significant engineering issues in [Haraj](https://haraj.com.sa) is code maintainability.

What is code maintainability? It is the ability of a codebase to be easily maintained by other developers. So when a developer can no longer maintain the codebase, other developers could easily take over the code they left behind.

As you may already know, Haraj engineering team is relatively small. So in our early days, we gave project ownership to the developer who started the project. This developer will be responsible for every aspect of the project: writing the code, deploying it to production, & maintaining it.

At that time, we did not set up common standards for writing code for those projects. So every developer writes code based on their style & preferences with almost no consideration for other developers.

Usually, our developers will stay for quite a long time (`~5 years`) before they leave. So when a developer leaves the team, they usually own several valuable projects for Haraj business. The problem is that since the projects were written in the developer's style, no one in the team could easily take over those projects. üòÖ

</p>

This is why code maintainability grows into such a big issue in Haraj, and the solution to prevent more of this is to set up common standards on how to write code in Haraj projects. This is where [Hexagonal Architecture](./docs/reference/hex-architecture.md) comes into play.

## Game Design

In the game you will play as a `10 years` old monster hunter that dreams to become the very best. In order to reach that, you need to make journey together with your monster partner to seek `3` strong wild monsters and kick them in the butt. üí•üí™üèª

The game scenario is pretty simple, player just need to choose monster partner then won battle for `3` times to beat the game. After that player may choose to end the game or continue playing.

Here is the flowchart for the game scenario:

## How to Run The Game

You can try out this game online by visiting this URL: https://hex-monscape.haraj.app.

If you want to run the game locally, make sure following applications already installed in your machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) `v20.10.23` or above => this will also install Docker Compose `v2.15.1`
- [make](https://linuxhint.com/make-command-linux/) => to execute the scripts for running the project defined in [Makefile](./Makefile)

After that use this command to run the game:

```bash
> make run
```

Wait for a moment until you see message like this:

```bash
rest-memory-client-1  | yarn run v1.22.19
rest-memory-client-1  | $ vite --host --port 8161
rest-memory-client-1  |
rest-memory-client-1  |   vite v2.8.4 dev server running at:
rest-memory-client-1  |
rest-memory-client-1  |   > Local:    http://localhost:8161/
rest-memory-client-1  |   > Network:  http://172.31.0.3:8161/
rest-memory-client-1  |
rest-memory-client-1  |   ready in 151ms.
```

After that you could access the game by visiting this URL: http://localhost:8161.

## Multiple Server Variants

Actually there are `3` variants of game server in this project:

- Server using In-Memory storage => run command: `make run-rest-memory`
- Server using DynamoDB storage => run command: `make run-rest-dynamodb`
- Server using MySQL storage => run command: `make run-rest-mysql`

All of them serve the same game, the only difference is the place where they store the game data.

For details on these commands, please refer to [this Makefile](./Makefile).

> **Note:**
>
> When we use [Hexagonal Architecture](./docs/reference/hex-architecture.md) to build an application, it is quite easy to swap its infrastructure code with another technologies.
>
> So for example, if initially we used in-memory storage to store our data, we could easily swap it with MySQL storage or something else. This is why in this project we provide `3` variants of game server for you, this is to demonstrate exactly this point.
